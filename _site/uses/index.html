<p>Most of the gear I use on a daily basis for work or hobbies. I thought it would be great to see how it evolves with time. Inspired by <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses">Wes Bos</a>. If you create your own, you can add it to <a href="https://uses.tech/">uses.tech</a>.</p>
<h2 id="coding"><a class="header-anchor" href="#coding">#</a> Coding</h2>
<ul>
<li>I code in VSCode with Shade of purple &amp; <a href="https://dank.sh/">Dank Mono</a> font.</li>
<li>I use iTerm2 for my terminal</li>
<li>I use Google Chrome as my main browser. I've been trying to switch to Firefox for a while, but the user management in Chrome is just so good.</li>
<li>I use Slack for communications with my team.</li>
<li>I usually listen to Lo Fi hip hop playlists on Spotify</li>
<li>I heavily take notes in Bear</li>
<li>I design in Figma or Sketch</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="computer"><a class="header-anchor" href="#computer">#</a> Computer</h2>
<p>My workspace is pretty small - only 42&quot; wide. Monitor, camera and microphone are all mounted on the desk using C-Clamps to maximize my desk space.</p>
<ul>
<li>My desk is a <a href="https://www.homedepot.ca/product/home-decorators-collection-72-inch-bamboo-countertop/1001086921">42&quot; Bamboo countertop</a> on Ikea legs.</li>
<li>My computer is a 15 inch 2019 MacBook Pro sitting on a <a href="https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html">Rain mStand</a>.</li>
<li>My monitor is a LG <a href="https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-27UK850">27UK860</a> mounted on an <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-accessories/monitor-arm">Autonomous Monitor Arm</a></li>
<li>My keyboard is an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQ052LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-silver">Apple Magic Keyboard</a> in Space Grey. I'm trying to get into mechanical keyboards but didn't commit yet.</li>
<li>My mouse is a <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/Logitech-910-001601-Souris-optique-filaire/dp/B003B4BBFK">M100 Logitech</a>. Cheap &amp; reliable.</li>
<li>My camera is an <em>old</em> Canon EOS T2i hooked with <a href="https://github.com/v002/v002-Camera-Live">Camera Live</a>. Price gouging on Elgato Cam Link because reasons (and that my camera doesn't output a clean hdmi signal) made me look for an alternative. Camera Live is not perfect as the FPS is on the low side but it's free and you only need a USB cable. If you have a Canon camera, I really recommend you try it out before spending money on a Cam Link.</li>
<li>My mic is a Yeti microphone mounted on a Compass boomarm with a Radius III shockmount that I bought as part of the <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeticaster/">Yeticaster bundle</a>. If you go the Yeti route, you can probably get a cheaper arm but the bundle made it an easy choice for me. #Marketing</li>
