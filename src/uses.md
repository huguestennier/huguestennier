# /uses

<time>Last updated: May 2nd, 2020</time>

Most of the gear I use on a daily basis for work or hobbies. I thought it would be great to see how it evolves with time. Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses). If you create your own, you can add it to [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/).

## Coding

- I code in VSCode with Shade of purple &amp; [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) font.
- I use iTerm2 for my terminal
- I use Google Chrome as my main browser. I've been trying to switch to Firefox for a while, but the user management in Chrome is just so good.  
- I use Slack for communications with my team.
- I usually listen to Lo Fi hip hop playlists on Spotify
- I heavily take notes in Bear
- I design in Figma or Sketch

## Computer

My workspace is pretty small - only 42" wide. Monitor, camera and microphone are all mounted on the desk using C-Clamps to maximize my desk space.
- My desk is a [42" Bamboo countertop](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/home-decorators-collection-72-inch-bamboo-countertop/1001086921) on Ikea legs.
- My computer is a 15 inch 2019 MacBook Pro sitting on a [Rain mStand](https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html).
- My monitor is a LG [27UK860](https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-27UK850) mounted on an [Autonomous Monitor Arm](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-accessories/monitor-arm)
- My keyboard is an [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQ052LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-us-english-silver) in Space Grey. I'm trying to get into mechanical keyboards but didn't commit yet.
- My mouse is a [M100 Logitech](https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/Logitech-910-001601-Souris-optique-filaire/dp/B003B4BBFK). Cheap &amp; reliable.
- My camera is an *old* Canon EOS T2i hooked with [Camera Live](https://github.com/v002/v002-Camera-Live). Price gouging on Elgato Cam Link because reasons (and that my camera doesn't output a clean hdmi signal) made me look for an alternative. Camera Live is not perfect as the FPS is on the low side but it's free and you only need a USB cable. If you have a Canon camera, I really recommend you try it out before spending money on a Cam Link.
- My mic is a Yeti microphone mounted on a Compass boomarm with a Radius III shockmount that I bought as part of the [Yeticaster bundle](https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/yeticaster/). If you go the Yeti route, you can probably get a cheaper arm but the bundle made it an easy choice for me. #Marketing
