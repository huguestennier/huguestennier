# hugues

Hugues is a skeleton theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en).

## How to use

* Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
* In your Hugo `config.yoml` file, add `theme = "hugues"`
* Clone this repository and place it under `/themes`
* `npm install` to install the dependencies needed
* `gulp` when you are developing
* `gulp build` to minify your assets
* Use the assets folder for `.scss` or `.js` files - every other static assets should go directly into the `static` folder.
