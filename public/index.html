 <h1>Hugues Tennier
  <br>front-end dev
</h1>
<p>
  I have been working in the industry for 10 years. I started as a UI designer, eventually becoming a teacher and co-founded
  a small digital studio. I'm now part of the Themes team at
  <a href="http://www.shopify.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Shopify, opens in a new window">Shopify</a> in Montréal as a front-end developer.
</p>
<h2>Upcoming talks</h2>
<p>I’m currently looking for more talks opportunities, so if you’re looking for a talk around UX, accessibility best practices
  or modern CSS techniques, let me know!</p>
<h2>Past talks</h2>
<p>
  <i>Accessibility is crucial: Get started now!</i>
  <br>
  <a href="https://webaquebec.org/" target="_blank">Web à Québec</a> &mdash; 2018</p>
<h2>Reach out</h2>
<p>If you want to reach out to discuss or just to say hi, your best bet is to
  <a href="mailto:h@huguestennier.com">email me</a>. Otherwise, I’m sometime lurking around Twitter
  <a href="https://twitter.com/huguestennier" aria-label="Go to twitter profile, opens in a new window">@huguestennier</a>.
</p>
<p>Sorry, but I’m currently
  <strong>not</strong> looking for a job as amazing as it probably is.</p> </main>
